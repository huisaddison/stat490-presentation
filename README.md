# STAT490 Presentation

Some slides for a presentation on risk bounds for the estimation of bandable
precision matrices.

Gives some background on graphical models and the multivariate Gaussian
distribution.  Touches on alternative methods, e.g. graphical lasso, for
precision matrix recovery.  Then discusses the
[Asymptotic Normal Thresholding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.6024) method
proposed by Zhou et al.
